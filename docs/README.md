## Project description

Use JavaScript, React, and CSS to complete the following prompt. Use of other libraries is not permitted.

You run a restaurant selling sandwiches and need some way of keeping track orders. Create a React app that allows your employees to create new orders and show when they've been picked up.

1. Create a form where a user can create orders.
● A user should be able to see each sandwich and how much they cost.
● A user should be able to add sandwiches to the order using a button.
● A user should not be able to add a sandwich we don't have ingredients for (seedata.json).
● A user should be able to see all items in an order.
● A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
● A user should be able to complete the order using a button.

2. Create a component that displays all active orders.
● A user should be able to uniquely identify orders from one another.
● A user should be able to see all items in an order.
● A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
● A user should be able to mark the order as "picked-up" by clicking a button.
● A user should be able to clearly distinguish "open" and "picked-up" orders.
